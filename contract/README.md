# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

npx hardhat run scripts/test.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

- Contract deployed at 0x3b6Ee16622eE252d61f3d18BA19d3400A2CDE4Dd
